This project will be completed in phases. The first phase will be to work on this document. Use github-flavoured markdown. (For more markdown help [click here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) or [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) )

All projects will require the following:
- Researching new forces to implement.
- Method for each new force, returning a `PVector`  -- similar to `getGravity` and `getSpring` (using whatever parameters are necessary).
- A distinct demonstration for each individual force (including gravity and the spring force).
- A visual menu at the top providing information about which simulation is currently active and indicating whether movement is on or off.
- The ability to toggle movement on/off
- The ability to toggle bouncing on/off
- The user should be able to switch _between_ simluations using the number keys as follows:
  - `1`: Gravity
  - `2`: Spring Force
  - `3`: Drag
  - `4`: Custom Force
  - `5`: Combination


## Phase 0: Force Selection, Analysis & Plan
---------- 

#### Custom Force: Lorentz Force (Electrodynamic and Magnetic Forces combined)

### Forumla
What is the formula for your force? Including descriptions/definitions for the symbols. (You may include a picture of the formula if it is not easily typed.)

$F_e = \frac {k_e q_A q_B}{r^2} \hat {AB}$

$F_B = ((q_B v_B B_A)sin Î¸) \hat {AB}$

combined: $F_L = q_B ((\frac {k_e q_A}{r^2})+(v_B)(\frac{\textmu_0 q_A v_A}{4\pi r^2})sin \theta) \hat {AB}$

### Custom Force
- What information that is already present in the `Orb` or `OrbNode` classes does this force use?
  - The distance between orbs and the velocity of each orb

- Does this force require any new constants, if so what are they and what values will you try initially?
  - The electrostatic constant $k_e = 8.99*10^{9} \frac{Nm^2}{C^2}$ (While coding, I will try to substitute with 1 and figure it out from there)
  - The elementary charge *e* = $1.6*10^{-19} C$ (While coding, I will try to substitute with 0.1 and figure it out from there)
  - The permittivity of free space $\textmu_0 = 4\pi*10^{-7} \frac{Tm}{A}$ (While coding, I will try to substitute with 0.01 and figure it out from there)

- Does this force require any new information to be added to the `Orb` class? If so, what is it and what data type will you use?
  - Charges of each orb(boolean)
  - If each orb is divided into electrons and protons, then they will exert both electrostatic and magnetic forces since they are moving charges
  - Initially, I will try with only single electrons to keep it simple
  - If I make a more complex model, charges will be ints that include negative and positive signs, and charges will also depend on size and mass

- Does this force interact with other `Orbs`, or is it applied based on the environment?
  - It is an Orb-Orb interactive force

- In order to calculate this force, do you need to perform extra intermediary calculations? If so, what?
  - Yes, the magnetic field strength created by moving charges

### Simulation 1: Gravity
Describe how you will attempt to simulate orbital motion.

A top-down view of a fixed massive central planet with multiple orbiting moons

--- 

### Simulation 2: Spring
Describe what your spring simulation will look like. Explain how it will be setup, and how it should behave while running.

1 fixed orb at the center-left region with linked list of orb nodes attached 

--- 

### Simulation 3: Drag
Describe what your drag simulation will look like. Explain how it will be setup, and how it should behave while running.

Randomized regions of variable drag coefficients in the shapes of circles around the simulation interface

--- 

### Simulation 4: Custom force
Describe what your Custom force simulation will look like. Explain how it will be setup, and how it should behave while running.

Lorentz force will show no effect at 1 orbnode(no fixed orbs) and only electrostatic force at 2 orbnodes. 
Then at 3 or more orbnodes in 2 dimensions, the magnetic force will also be shown interacting with the orbs.
(First step will only be electrons, protons will be "discovered" later)

--- 

### Simulation 5: Combination
Describe what your combination simulation will look like. Explain how it will be setup, and how it should behave while running.

The combination simulation should include drag, gravity, and the lorentz forces. In the future, we plan to also simulate a coilgun.
